# Security Notice

## Files with Account-Specific Values

The following files contain hardcoded AWS account IDs and should be regenerated for each deployment:

### Generated by Infrastructure Scripts:
- `policies/policy-*.json` - Generated by `infra/10-iam.sh`
- `policies/indexer-*.json` - Generated by infrastructure scripts
- `assume-*.json` - Role assumption documents
- `ecs-*.json` - ECS task definitions

### Development Files:
- `data/seed-manifest.json` - Contains bucket names with account IDs
- `docs/dev-journal.md` - Development notes with specific resource names

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit** files with real AWS account IDs to public repositories
2. **Use templates** with variable substitution instead of hardcoded values
3. **Regenerate policies** during deployment using the infrastructure scripts
4. **Review .gitignore** to ensure sensitive files are excluded

## Clean Deployment

For a clean deployment without hardcoded values:

1. Use the infrastructure scripts in `infra/` directory
2. Set environment variables in `.env` file (not committed)
3. Let scripts generate account-specific policies dynamically
4. Use the `.env.template` as a starting point
